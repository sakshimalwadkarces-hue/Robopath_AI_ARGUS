# MindForgeAI Industry Project — Master Workspace

This repository is the standard 30-day engineering workspace for every Internship 1.0 project group. Clone it once for the group. Preserve this structure. Add work inside the correct folder instead of creating unrelated folders at the root.

## First setup

1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.
2. Read `00_project_governance/WORKING_RULES.md` with the complete team.
3. Run `scripts/create_member_workspace.ps1 STUDENT_ID` on Windows PowerShell or `bash scripts/create_member_workspace.sh STUDENT_ID` on macOS/Linux.
4. Each member copies their existing current working folder into their generated folder under `04_active_workspaces/`.
5. Do experimental work only inside the member workspace. Move reviewed, team-approved work into `05_shared_integration/` and then the relevant production folder.
6. Record sources, decisions, tasks and diary entries as the work happens.

## Repository map

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `00_project_governance` | team charter, roles, working rules and quality gates |
| `01_project_definition` | title, structured abstract, scope, requirements and architecture |
| `02_research_and_sources` | literature, web research log, citations and source assessments |
| `03_data_and_resources` | data documentation, licences, resource inventory and non-secret setup notes |
| `04_active_workspaces` | one isolated current working folder per student |
| `05_shared_integration` | reviewed work waiting for integration into the common solution |
| `06_code` | stable source, notebooks, tests, configuration and reusable scripts |
| `07_models_and_artifacts` | versioned model metadata and reproducible output manifests; avoid huge binaries in Git |
| `08_project_report` | chapter-wise report, drafts, figures, tables and references |
| `09_project_diaries` | separate group and individual daily project diaries |
| `10_management` | tasks, meeting records, decisions, risks and change notes |
| `11_deployment` | container, cloud, monitoring, rollback and runbook assets |
| `12_presentation_and_demo` | slides, demo script, screenshots, rehearsal and backup demo |
| `13_release_and_handover` | final release, checksums, installation, user guide and handover |
| `study_material` | approved learning material relevant to this project |

## Branch and review model

- `main`: reviewed and demonstrable group state.
- `develop`: integrated work for the next stable checkpoint.
- `member/<student-id>/<task>`: individual task branch.
- No member pushes experimental code directly to `main`.
- A merge requires a meaningful commit message, evidence of testing and team awareness.

## Security

Never commit passwords, API keys, AWS credentials, private student data, `.env` files, service-account JSON, raw identity documents or proprietary datasets. Commit `.env.example` with placeholder names only.

## Portal relationship

The online Project Portal is the shared operational record. This repository is the technical and document workspace. Update both deliberately:

- Portal: tasks, daily diary, abstract/report working text, notes and links.
- Repository: code, notebooks, tests, formal report source, diagrams, deployment assets and evidence.
- Printed diary: signed physical group record.
